# FunStuff

A minecraft plugin for our server. Is a collection of things that I made that I think are fun, like a bow that teleports you to where arrows shot by it land, snowballs that explode
## Building

Project is built using IntelliJ IDEA Community. Simply take the jar that is output (or create one for ouput if necessary) and put it into the plugins folder on your spigot or paper server.
